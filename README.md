# Consensus (final for cis197)

## Consensus is an app that will change how your group decides

Normally, with typical groupchats or polls made in FB mesenger, it always ends in a bunch of confusion or lack of participation:

When filling out a when2meet, the interface looks like it's from 1995 and you can't even tell which time is the one whne most are available or who can even make it

When you make a poll in your FB Messenger groupchat, you get only about half the people to respond and you get decision fatigue from how busy the chat is or how frequently the poll seems to update itself with options.

### With Consensus, you can change the way that you decide.

With an intuitive interface and an even better voting system, it's always immediately apparent what the most popular option is as of now and what times most people will be free, while telling you exactly who's free at what times.

Want to add a new suggestion? Put out a new card with maybe a small description of why you think it's the right choice, and post it onto the main board. Want to make a poll on what time is best to meet? - ... to be continued...
